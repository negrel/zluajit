# `zluajit` - Zig bindings to LuaJIT C API

`zluajit` provides high quality, ergonomic, well documented and type-safe
bindings to LuaJIT 5.1/5.2 C API. Supporting other Lua versions is a non goal.

## Getting started

See [`examples`](./examples/README.md) to get started embedding LuaJIT in Zig
program or build Zig modules that can be imported from Lua.

It is strongly recommended to build programs depending on `zluajit` using the
LLVM backend (at least for now).

## Building `luajit`

You can build `luajit` executable using `zig build luajit`.
